Hello,

I am {name} , co-organizer at Ansible {place/city of the meetup} Meetup [0].

Ansible is an open-source community project sponsored by Red Hat [1]. It is the simplest way to automate IT. Ansible delivers simple IT automation that ends repetitive tasks and frees up DevOps teams for more strategic work. Ansible Community [2] is a gathering of a small group of Systems Engineers, DevOps, and SREs to discuss their automation journey focusing on Ansible. Ansible {place/city of the meetup} Meetup is a platform for upstream and downstream to meet each other to share knowledge and Ansible stories. We meet every month/once in two months to talk about the above said topics and ideas.

We are looking for a place to hold our meetups with the following specifications
    1. Expected Attendees are {number}
    2. Presentation setup
    3. Recording - audio, video setup, microphone for the audience
    4. Wifi

We are looking forward to your reply.
