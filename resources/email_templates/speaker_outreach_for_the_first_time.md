Hello,
 
I am {name} , co-organizer at Ansible {place/city of the meetup} Meetup [0].

Ansible is an open-source community project sponsored by Red Hat [1].
It is the simplest way to automate IT. Ansible delivers simple IT automation that ends repetitive tasks and frees up DevOps teams for more strategic work.
Ansible Community [2] is a gathering of a small group of Systems Engineers, DevOps, and SREs to discuss their automation journey focusing on Ansible.
Ansible {place/city of the meetup} Meetup is a platform for upstream and downstream to meet each other to share knowledge and Ansible stories.
We meet every month/once in two months to talk about the above-mentioned topics and ideas. 

{Share the reference you met or learned about the potential speaker and their work. Also, why would their talk be helpful for the event, group, and community? You can share some ideas for the talks with them.} 

Would you be interested in giving a talk or taking a workshop or hands-on session on {date} for the {name of the group}?

Please let me know if you need further information.

I will look forward to your answer.

Thank you,
{your_name}
