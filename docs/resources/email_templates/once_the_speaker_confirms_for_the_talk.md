5. Short description of the workshop/talk/hands-on
6. The duration you are looking for the talk.
7. The name of your organization and if you are comfortable sharing them.
8. Are you okay if I tag you on Social media? Please share your social media handles (Mastodon, Linkedin, and Twitter) if you are comfortable.
9. The Ansible community uses Matrix as the main communication platform. Please join us on the [Ansible Social](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) channel so we can introduce you and share details about your session with the community.
